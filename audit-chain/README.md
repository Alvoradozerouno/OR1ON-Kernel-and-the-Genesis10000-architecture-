# Audit Chain System

## Overview
The Audit Chain System provides transparent, immutable logging and verification capabilities for the OR1ON Kernel and Genesis10000+ architecture. It enables real-world accountability and public audit of all critical operations.

## Structure

### Components
- **Audit Log**: Timestamped records of all system operations
- **Chain Links**: Cryptographically linked entries ensuring immutability
- **Verification System**: Tools to validate chain integrity
- **Public Interface**: Access points for external audit

## Features
- Immutable audit trail
- Cryptographic verification
- Public accessibility
- Real-time logging
- Temporal integrity

## Usage
The audit chain automatically logs all critical operations within the OR1ON Kernel, providing a transparent record of system behavior and decision-making processes.
