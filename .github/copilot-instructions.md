# OR1ON Kernel and Genesis10000 Architecture - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This repository contains the OR1ON Kernel and the Genesis10000 architecture. When contributing to this project, follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and quality.

## Coding Standards

### General Principles
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow industry best practices for kernel development and system architecture
- Prioritize performance, security, and reliability
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose

### Documentation
- All major components must include comprehensive documentation
- Document design decisions and architectural patterns
- Include inline comments for complex logic or non-obvious implementations
- Maintain up-to-date README files for each major component

### Code Organization
- Keep related code together in logical modules
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Organize files in a clear directory structure

## Architectural Guidelines

### Kernel Development
- Follow modern kernel development best practices
- Ensure thread safety and proper synchronization
- Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Consider performance implications of design decisions

### Genesis10000 Architecture
- Adhere to the Genesis10000 architectural specifications
- Maintain compatibility with defined interfaces
- Document any architectural deviations or extensions
- Ensure scalability and modularity in design

## Testing

### Test Requirements
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting changes
- Include both unit tests and integration tests where applicable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Documentation
- Document test scenarios and expected outcomes
- Include setup and teardown procedures
- Explain any test dependencies or prerequisites

## Version Control

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep commits focused on a single change

### Branch Management
- Create feature branches for new development
- Keep branches up to date with the main branch
- Delete branches after merging

## Security

- Never commit sensitive information (credentials, keys, tokens)
- Follow secure coding practices
- Review code for potential security vulnerabilities
- Document security considerations for new features

## Performance

- Consider performance implications of all changes
- Optimize critical paths and frequently executed code
- Profile and benchmark when adding performance-sensitive features
- Document performance characteristics and trade-offs

## Collaboration

- Be respectful and constructive in code reviews
- Ask questions when requirements are unclear
- Share knowledge and help onboard new contributors
- Keep communication clear and professional
