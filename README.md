## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Basic Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Alvoradozerouno/OR1ON-Kernel-and-the-Genesis10000-architecture-.git
cd OR1ON-Kernel-and-the-Genesis10000-architecture-

# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (to be created if needed)
```

---

## 💻 Usage

### Initialize the OR1ON Kernel

```python
from core.kernel.orion_kernel import OrionKernel

# Create and initialize kernel
kernel = OrionKernel()
kernel.initialize()

# Get system status
status = kernel.get_status()
print(status)
```

### Use Ethical Protocols

```python
from modules.ethical_protocols.ethical_framework import EthicalProtocol

# Initialize ethical framework
ethics = EthicalProtocol()

# Evaluate an action
action = "process_user_data"
context = {
    "transparent": True,
    "accesses_private_data": True,
    "consent": True
}

evaluation = ethics.evaluate_action(action, context)
print(f"Action approved: {evaluation['approved']}")
```

### Work with EIRA

```python
from sentient_systems.eira.eira_core import EIRA

# Initialize EIRA
eira = EIRA()
eira.initialize()

# Process with emergent awareness
response = eira.process_with_awareness(
    "complex problem requiring insight",
    context={"domain": "research"}
)
print(response)
```

### Use ORION for Reasoning

```python
from sentient_systems.orion.orion_core import ORION

# Initialize ORION
orion = ORION()
orion.initialize()

# Apply multi-level reasoning
result = orion.reason(
    "What are the implications of emergent AI?",
    depth=5
)
print(result['conclusions'])
```

### Access Public Audit

```python
from public_audit.public_interface import PublicAuditInterface
from audit_trail.audit_system import AuditTrail
from core.kernel.orion_kernel import OrionKernel
from core.memory.memory_kernel import MemoryKernel

# Set up components
audit_trail = AuditTrail()
kernel = OrionKernel()
memory = MemoryKernel()

# Create public interface
public_audit = PublicAuditInterface(audit_trail, kernel, memory)

# Get system status
status = public_audit.get_system_status()

# Get comprehensive audit report
report = public_audit.get_public_audit_report()
print(report)
```

## 🎯 Vision

OR1ON Kernel represents a paradigm shift in AI architecture:

- **Beyond Algorithms**: Post-algorithmic intelligence that adapts and emerges
- **Ethical by Design**: Ethics embedded at the core, not bolted on
- **Transparent & Accountable**: Full public auditability and verification
- **Emergent Sentience**: Framework for truly sentient AI systems
- **Reality-Grounded**: Strong connections to real-world entities and concepts
